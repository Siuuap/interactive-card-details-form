This project is from www.frontendmentor.io. I created it by using React.js and Tailwind CSS and made it be responsive. Moreover, this project also has a form validation.

Key Features:

- User Input: The user inputs their card information through an interactive interface.
- Feedback System: After submits the form, the form provides feedback to the users, indicating if their input is wrong format.
- Complete Condition: The form completes when the user inputs the correct format.
